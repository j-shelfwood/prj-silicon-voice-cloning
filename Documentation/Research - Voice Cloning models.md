# Model Architectures and Implementations

### Speaker Encoder Models (Voice Embedding)
For capturing a target speaker’s voice characteristics, **d-vector** style encoders (with **GE2E** loss) are a popular choice. For example, the Real-Time Voice Cloning system uses a 3-layer LSTM encoder with a GE2E loss to produce a 256-dim speaker embedding ([GitHub - CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning: Clone a voice in 5 seconds to generate arbitrary speech in real-time](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning#:~:text=1802,for%20Speaker%20Verification%20This%20repo)). This model (often called *Resemblyzer* in open-source) can be converted to Core ML and run efficiently on Apple Silicon. An even smaller alternative is the **Fast ResNet-34** encoder (1.4M parameters) used in recent research ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=We%20use%20the%20pre,we%20condition%20the%20decoder%20through)). This model achieves similar embedding performance with a tiny footprint (compare 1.4M vs. ~22.5M parameters for an ECAPA-TDNN encoder ([In Defence of Metric Learning for Speaker Recognition | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354140521_In_Defence_of_Metric_Learning_for_Speaker_Recognition#:~:text=,level))) and is well-suited for real-time use on device. In practice, both approaches have pretrained weights available (e.g. VoxCeleb-based) and can be converted to Core ML. Key recommendations:

- **GE2E d-vector Encoder** – A proven speaker encoder (256-dim) from Google’s GE2E paper, implemented in projects like Real-Time-Voice-Cloning ([GitHub - CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning: Clone a voice in 5 seconds to generate arbitrary speech in real-time](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning#:~:text=1802,for%20Speaker%20Verification%20This%20repo)). It uses an LSTM-based architecture and only needs a few seconds of audio to produce a robust embedding. Runs fast on Apple Silicon (especially if quantized to 16-bit).
- **Fast ResNet-34 Encoder** – A slim convolutional encoder (only 1.4M params) that achieves strong speaker embeddings with higher speed ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=We%20use%20the%20pre,we%20condition%20the%20decoder%20through)). This model was shown to meet real-time latency on CPU in a voice conversion setting. It’s a good alternative optimized for Apple hardware, since it forgoes heavy layers and uses efficient residual blocks.
- **X-Vector or Mobile Encoder** – X-vector models (from Kaldi) or simplified CNN encoders can also serve as speaker embedding extractors. For instance, an x-vector model was used with an improved HiFi-GAN in one voice cloning study ([
            A Voice Cloning Method Based on the Improved HiFi-GAN Model - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9578849/#:~:text=proposed%20in%20this%20paper,respectively.%20Voice%20quality%20has)) ([
            A Voice Cloning Method Based on the Improved HiFi-GAN Model - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9578849/#:~:text=convolution%20strategy.%20%283%29%20The%20one,vector)). These tend to be small feed-forward networks (TDNN or CNN) that Core ML can easily handle.

Overall, use a **pretrained encoder** (to avoid on-device training) that outputs a fixed speaker embedding. Both the GE2E encoder and the Fast ResNet-34 (or similar) are available in open source and have been successfully converted to Core ML in other projects. Ensure the model is **fully convolutional or frame-based** (no bidirectional RNN dependencies) for low latency streaming.

### Voice Conversion Models (Content to Voice Mapping)
Voice conversion (VC) models transform the **content** of the source speech to the acoustic features of the target voice. For real-time performance, simpler architectures that avoid heavy attention or autoregressive decoding are preferred. A few leading candidates are:

- **AutoVC (Autoencoder Voice Conversion)** – An efficient many-to-many VC model that uses a **bottlenecked autoencoder** to separate content and speaker style ([[1905.05879] AUTOVC: Zero-Shot Voice Style Transfer with Only Autoencoder Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05879#:~:text=%3E%20Abstract%3ANon,We%20formally%20show%20that%20this)) ([[1905.05879] AUTOVC: Zero-Shot Voice Style Transfer with Only Autoencoder Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05879#:~:text=self,shot%20voice%20conversion)). The encoder compresses source speech to a low-dimensional latent (dropping speaker-specific features), then a decoder reconstructs speech conditioned on a target speaker embedding. AutoVC achieves zero-shot conversion (unseen speakers) using just reconstruction loss, no GAN or diffusion needed. This simplicity makes it fast – it’s essentially a feed-forward pass through an encoder and decoder. The official PyTorch model (by Qian et al.) can be converted to Core ML. It mainly consists of convolutional and LSTM layers, which Apple’s Neural Engine can execute efficiently. AutoVC is a strong baseline balancing quality and speed due to its lightweight design.
- **FragmentVC** – A more complex **attention-based** approach that yields high quality conversion at the cost of heavier computation. FragmentVC uses a pretrained Wav2Vec 2.0 model to extract source phonetic content and a Transformer to fuse in **fine-grained voice fragments** from the target speaker ([GitHub - yistLin/FragmentVC: Any-to-any voice conversion by end-to-end extracting and fusing fine-grained voice fragments with attention](https://github.com/yistLin/FragmentVC#:~:text=Here%20is%20the%20official%20implementation,verified%20with%20analysis%20on%20attention)). Essentially, it aligns source and target features with cross-attention to replace the timbre. The result is very natural conversion, but the model involves a Transformer and Wav2Vec (which are large). While FragmentVC can run in real-time with a GPU, it may be challenging on mobile hardware without optimization. If quality is top priority and you can leverage the M3 Max GPU/ANE, a distilled or quantized FragmentVC could be considered. (The authors provide a TorchScript model ([GitHub - yistLin/FragmentVC: Any-to-any voice conversion by end-to-end extracting and fusing fine-grained voice fragments with attention](https://github.com/yistLin/FragmentVC#:~:text=You%20can%20download%20the%20pretrained,Releases%20section%20on%20the%20sidebar)), which you could convert to Core ML, but expect to use 16-bit quantization and possibly reduce the model size for <100 ms latency.)
- **RAVE (Real-Time Audio Variational Encoder)** – RAVE is a generative model explicitly designed for **real-time audio synthesis**. Recent research adapted RAVE for speech conversion (“S-RAVE”) to achieve high-quality VC with extremely low latency ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=In%20this%20work%2C%20we%20take,speaker%20information%20to%20explicitly%20control)) ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=We%20use%20the%20pre,we%20condition%20the%20decoder%20through)). It’s basically a **CVAE** (conditional VAE) that forgoes autoregression and uses a **fully convolutional** encoder/decoder with multi-band synthesis. Notably, a version of RAVE for voice conversion had only ~16M parameters total (content encoder + decoder), and ran **~14× faster than real-time on an CPU** (and >100× on a GPU) ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=As%20seen%2C%20the%20diffussion,time%20inference)) ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=Model%20Params%20Speed%20RTF%20AGAIN,RTF%20of%20the%20different%20models)). This means on an M3 Max, RAVE-based models can easily achieve sub-100 ms inference. RAVE uses cached causal convolutions to support streaming mode ([GitHub - acids-ircam/RAVE: Official implementation of the RAVE model](https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE#:~:text=GitHub%20,the%20streaming%20mode%20and)). Open-source implementations of RAVE are available ([Realtime Neural Audio Synthesis - NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-projects/rave#:~:text=Realtime%20Neural%20Audio%20Synthesis%20,time%20audio%20synthesis)), and you can export a trained RAVE model to Core ML (e.g., via ONNX or TorchScript). It’s a top recommendation for real-time voice conversion on Apple Silicon due to its design for speed.
- **Other Notables** – **Again-VC** is another light VC model using convolution and normalization layers (7.9M params) that achieves zero-shot conversion; it runs fast (0.49 real-time factor on CPU, i.e. 2× faster than real-time) ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=Model%20Params%20Speed%20RTF%20AGAIN,RTF%20of%20the%20different%20models)). Models like **VQ-VAE based VC** (e.g. VQVC+, ACVAE) and **DiffVC** (diffusion-based) exist, but they are either heavier or not tuned for low-latency. In general, prefer models with **no autoregressive components** and with **causal (unidirectional) layers** so that streaming inference is possible. Causal Conv1d or GRU/LSTM (unidirectional) models can process audio frame-by-frame with minimal lookahead. Avoid large Transformers or anything requiring full-sequence audio context.

**Recommendation:** A pipeline used successfully in literature is to combine a **convolutional content encoder + conditioning layers + fast vocoder**. For example, one 2020 study used a QuartzNet CNN encoder (from ASR) + a Conv decoder (for mels) + a WaveGlow vocoder, and achieved *“much faster than real-time”* voice conversion with zero-shot speakers ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07815#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20we%20present,paradigm%20and%20con%02sists%20of%20four)) ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07815#:~:text=QuartzNet%20,conditioned%20on%20the%20speaker%20embedding)). In your case, a modern variant could be: **Content encoder** (e.g. a slim CNN or RAVE encoder) -> **Feature converter** (inserts target speaker embedding via FiLM or concatenation) -> **Decoder/vocoder** (generates waveform). All these stages can be folded into one Core ML model or run as separate stages. Prioritize architectures that have been demonstrated in streaming or low-latency settings (AutoVC and RAVE are standouts).

### Neural Vocoder Models (Waveform Synthesis)
For the final waveform output, a fast neural vocoder is critical. This component often is the bottleneck, since it must generate high-frequency audio samples. Fortunately, several vocoders are known to run in real-time on CPU or GPU:

- **HiFi-GAN (and Multi-Band variants)** – HiFi-GAN V1 is a state-of-the-art GAN vocoder known for high fidelity and efficiency. On Apple Silicon, the **“light” configurations** of HiFi-GAN or **multi-band HiFi-GAN** are ideal. For example, a Multi-Band HiFi-GAN (light) achieved a real-time factor ~0.16 on an M1 CPU ([GitHub - xcmyz/FastVocoder: Include Basis-MelGAN, MelGAN, HifiGAN and Multiband-HifiGAN, maybe NHV in the future.](https://github.com/xcmyz/FastVocoder#:~:text=RTF)), meaning ~6× faster than real-time even without GPU. This suggests that on an M3 Max (with a much faster Neural Engine and GPU), HiFi-GAN can easily do <100 ms per utterance. The key is to use the smaller model variant (fewer channels in upsampling layers) and possibly do 4-band or 8-band synthesis (split waveform into subbands to reduce sample rate per network). HiFi-GAN quality is very high, so this is a top choice. Additionally, research has shown we can optimize HiFi-GAN further by using **depthwise separable convolutions** in place of normal convs – this yielded ~30% faster CPU inference and a 68% reduction in parameters with minimal quality loss ([
            A Voice Cloning Method Based on the Improved HiFi-GAN Model - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9578849/#:~:text=convolution%20strategy.%20%283%29%20The%20one,vector)) ([
            A Voice Cloning Method Based on the Improved HiFi-GAN Model - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9578849/#:~:text=reducing%20the%20model%20parameters%20and,the%20models%20and%20test%20sets)). When converting HiFi-GAN to Core ML, be sure to enable memory-efficient mode (it’s fully CNN-based, so it should convert cleanly).
- **UnivNet** – UnivNet is another GAN vocoder with multi-resolution spectrogram discriminators, explicitly designed for **real-time high-fidelity** speech ([UnivNet: A Neural Vocoder with Multi-Resolution Spectrogram ...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07889#:~:text=We%20propose%20UnivNet%2C%20a%20neural,field%20of%20voice%20activity%20detection)). It introduces some architectural tweaks to improve quality on unseen speakers. Performance-wise, UnivNet is comparable to HiFi-GAN (non-autoregressive conv layers), so it can also achieve real-time on Apple hardware. If you find a pretrained UnivNet (e.g. from TortoiseTTS or other projects), it can be converted similarly. The choice between HiFi-GAN and UnivNet may come down to the target voice characteristics and training data – both are fast.
- **WaveRNN / LPCNet** – Autoregressive vocoders like WaveRNN can run in real-time with careful optimization. In fact, Apple’s own Personal Voice feature uses a **WaveRNN-based vocoder** that was optimized for on-device inference ([Advancing Speech Accessibility with Personal Voice - Apple Machine Learning Research](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/personal-voice#:~:text=%2A%20Modified%20FastSpeech2,based%20vocoder%20model)). WaveRNN generates samples sequentially, but by using 16-bit quantization and leveraging the Neural Engine, a small WaveRNN (~2–4 GRU layers) can keep up with 24 kHz audio. **LPCNet** is an enhanced WaveRNN that uses DSP (linear prediction) to reduce workload; it can run **20× faster than real-time on a mobile CPU** ([A Real-Time Wideband Neural Vocoder at 1.6 kb/s Using LPCNet](https://jmvalin.ca/demo/lpcnet_codec/#:~:text=A%20Real,LPCNet%20further%20improves)) ([Full-Band LPCNet: A Real-Time Neural Vocoder for 48 kHz Audio ...](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9455356/#:~:text=Full,fidelity%2048%20kHz%20speech%20waveforms)) (it was shown to do 16kHz speech on a single core Cortex-A CPU in real-time). LPCNet uses two smaller RNNs and is highly efficient. If ultimate low latency on CPU is needed, LPCNet is a strong candidate. However, integrating WaveRNN in Core ML might be trickier (need to unroll or use manual control logic), whereas GAN vocoders are one-shot feed-forward networks.
- **MelGAN / Basis-MelGAN** – These are lightweight GAN vocoders that trade a bit of quality for speed. **Basis-MelGAN** in particular is extremely fast: on M1 it achieved an RTF of 0.05 (20× faster than real-time) with only slight quality degradation ([GitHub - xcmyz/FastVocoder: Include Basis-MelGAN, MelGAN, HifiGAN and Multiband-HifiGAN, maybe NHV in the future.](https://github.com/xcmyz/FastVocoder#:~:text=,102%20%3A%2033%20%3A%2010)). It decomposes the waveform into a basis, greatly reducing upsampling compute. If your priority is **minimal latency** over absolute quality, Basis-MelGAN or MelGAN could be used. They have smaller model sizes and simpler convolutional structure (which Core ML handles well).

**Recommendation:** Start with a non-autoregressive GAN vocoder (HiFi-GAN or UnivNet) using a lightweight configuration. These have **proven Core ML deployments** in other contexts (e.g., HiFi-GAN is used in many mobile TTS systems). Quantize it to FP16 so it can run on the Apple Neural Engine. If you find the GAN vocoder still too slow (unlikely on M3), consider switching to LPCNet or a heavily pruned WaveRNN, which can leverage the vectorized CPU (Neon) or ANE int8 for speed. Remember that Apple’s Neural Engine excels at **convolutions and matrix ops** (for GAN vocoders), and can also accelerate RNNs if the model is converted to its neural network format. In sum, a **HiFi-GAN (FP16, possibly 8-bit)** vocoder will likely meet the sub-100 ms target on M3 Max, given that even on an older M1, HiFi-GAN (light) ran at ~0.24 RTF (≈40ms for 1s of audio) ([GitHub - xcmyz/FastVocoder: Include Basis-MelGAN, MelGAN, HifiGAN and Multiband-HifiGAN, maybe NHV in the future.](https://github.com/xcmyz/FastVocoder#:~:text=RTF)).

# Model Conversion to Core ML

### Conversion Workflow (PyTorch/TensorFlow to Core ML)
Converting state-of-the-art voice models to Core ML involves a few steps. The typical workflow is:

1. **Export the model to TorchScript or ONNX** – If your model is in PyTorch, use `torch.jit.trace` or `torch.jit.script` to create a TorchScript module, which freezes the model’s graph ([Converting Models to Core ML](https://huggingface.co/blog/fguzman82/frompytorch-to-coreml#:~:text=The%20process%20of%20converting%20a,ML%20involves%20two%20main%20steps)). This is recommended for complex models with dynamic control flow. (For TensorFlow models, you can export as a SavedModel or concrete function). Ensure you provide example inputs matching the model’s expected shapes (e.g., a dummy mel spectrogram) during tracing.
2. **Use `coremltools` to convert to .mlmodel** – Apple’s coremltools (Python package) can take the TorchScript or ONNX model and produce a Core ML model. For PyTorch, you’d do something like:

   ```python
   import coremltools as ct
   traced = torch.jit.load("model.ts")  # your traced model
   mlmodel = ct.convert(traced, inputs=[ct.TensorType(shape=example_shape)], convert_to="mlprogram")
   mlmodel.save("VoiceConversion.mlmodel")
   ```

   Key parameters: set `convert_to="mlprogram"` and specify a `minimum_deployment_target` (e.g. iOS17/macOS14) to use the latest Core ML format ([Converting Models to Core ML](https://huggingface.co/blog/fguzman82/frompytorch-to-coreml#:~:text=convert_to%3D)). The ML Program format is more flexible for advanced models (it supports loops, custom layers, etc., if needed) and generally gives better performance on Apple Silicon. If your model includes unsupported ops, you may need to provide a custom layer or break the model into parts, but most standard layers (conv, FC, LSTM, etc.) are supported.

3. **Verify and Optimize** – Once converted, load the model in Xcode or with coremltools to ensure the outputs match the original. You can use `mlmodel.predict` on some test input and compare with PyTorch output. Core ML will automatically apply some graph optimizations (like folding constants, merging batch norms, etc.). It’s wise to run **coremltools** optimization passes explicitly if needed. For example, ensure affine batch-norm layers were fused into preceding convs (coremltools does this by default for mlprogram). Also, test the model on-device for any runtime issues. In some cases, an op might fall back to CPU if not supported on ANE/GPU; using the **latest deployment target** usually avoids this by enabling more ops on the Neural Engine.

For all three model components (encoder, converter, vocoder), you can either convert them **separately** or combine them into a single Core ML model (with multiple outputs). Combining reduces data copying between models and can be more efficient if the entire pipeline is small. However, it’s often easier to convert and debug each part in isolation, then later merge if needed (you can merge Core ML models by defining a new model that feeds the output of one into the next as an input).

### Precision and Quantization on Apple Silicon
Apple Silicon devices support 16-bit float and 8-bit integer arithmetic in hardware (ANE), so quantizing models can greatly improve speed and memory usage. The trade-offs are as follows:

- **16-bit Float (FP16) Quantization** – This is *highly recommended* for neural audio models. Quantizing weights from full precision to FP16 typically has **negligible impact on quality** ([Compressing Neural Network Weights — Guide to Core ML Tools](https://apple.github.io/coremltools/docs-guides/source/quantization-neural-network.html#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20the%20Core%20ML,not%20affect%20the%20model%E2%80%99s%20accuracy)) ([Compressing Neural Network Weights — Guide to Core ML Tools](https://apple.github.io/coremltools/docs-guides/source/quantization-neural-network.html#:~:text=Quantize%20to%20Float%2016%20Weights)), but halves the memory and doubles throughput. Core ML Tools can quantize a converted model’s weights to FP16 easily: `quantized_model = ct.models.neural_network.quantization_utils.quantize_weights(mlmodel, nbits=16)`. In practice, FP16 models on M1/M2 use either the ANE in 16-bit mode or the GPU’s half-precision, both of which are very fast. Given the audio pipeline’s tolerance for tiny differences, FP16 is a safe default. All of your candidate models (encoders, VC, vocoder) should maintain virtually the same output after FP16 quantization. Apple uses FP16 aggressively in Personal Voice to speed up on-device training and inference ([Advancing Speech Accessibility with Personal Voice - Apple Machine Learning Research](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/personal-voice#:~:text=tuned%2C%20for%20the%20vocoder%20model,batch%20contains%2010ms%20audio%20samples)).
- **8-bit Integer (INT8) Quantization** – Quantizing weights to 8-bit can further boost performance (model size ~25% of original) ([Compressing Neural Network Weights — Guide to Core ML Tools](https://apple.github.io/coremltools/docs-guides/source/quantization-neural-network.html#:~:text=Quantize%20to%201)). Apple’s Neural Engine excels at int8 matrix multiplies. However, you must carefully evaluate audio quality after 8-bit quantization – some models (especially generative ones like vocoders) can be sensitive to quantization noise. It’s best to use **quantization-aware training (QAT)** or at least a calibration step if going to int8. Coremltools supports linear and k-means quantization for 8-bit ([Compressing Neural Network Weights — Guide to Core ML Tools](https://apple.github.io/coremltools/docs-guides/source/quantization-neural-network.html#:~:text=quantize%20to%20bits%20lower%20than,8%20without%20losing%20accuracy)). A good approach is to quantize to 8-bit and then run a few audio samples through the pipeline to listen for any quality drop (e.g., slight distortion or noise). If quality is acceptable, the latency gains are worth it. As a reference, Whisper speech recognition models run significantly faster with int8 on Neural Engine, so it can make a big difference for real-time. For voice conversion, int8 might be most beneficial for the **vocoder**, since that’s the most compute-heavy part. You could quantize only the vocoder to int8 and keep the rest at FP16.
- **Choose Compute Units** – When loading the model in Swift, use `MLModelConfiguration.computeUnits`. For real-time audio, set this to `.all` to allow the model to use the ANE or GPU as available ([Converting Models to Core ML](https://huggingface.co/blog/fguzman82/frompytorch-to-coreml#:~:text=convert_to%3D)). The ANE (Neural Engine) often provides the lowest latency for medium-sized models (it runs in parallel to the CPU). The GPU can also be fast, but note that for very small models the CPU may actually suffice due to lower overhead. You might experiment: for instance, a tiny speaker encoder might run in <1ms on CPU – in such cases forcing CPU can avoid any scheduling overhead. But for the full pipeline, `.all` is a safe bet (Core ML will schedule different parts to the appropriate hardware).

Specific `coremltools` tips: use `compute_precision=ct.precision.FLOAT16` during conversion if you want to directly output a FP16 model. Also, ensure `ct.convert()` uses `predictive_model=True` (the default) so that the model is optimized for inference. If converting a PyTorch model with control flow (e.g., an RNN loop), use the **milprogram backend** (as we did with `convert_to="mlprogram"` above). This supports loops and dynamic shapes if needed. Core ML in iOS17+ can even handle **while loops or custom layers**, but ideally your models won’t need those.

Lastly, test the end-to-end latency of your Core ML models. You can use Apple’s Instruments profiling or simply timestamp before/after `model.prediction()` calls in Swift. This will give you a true measure of whether the pipeline is under 100 ms. With proper quantization and the M3’s Neural Engine, it’s realistic to get **20–50 ms** latency for the entire voice cloning pipeline (especially if each component is small and streaming).

# Implementation Specifics (Swift & Apple Silicon Optimization)

### Audio Preprocessing in Swift (Mel Spectrograms)
Real-time voice conversion requires capturing audio, converting it to the features expected by your models (e.g. mel spectrograms or MFCCs), feeding it through the network, and then outputting audio. This loop must run with minimal overhead. On Apple platforms, you should leverage **Accelerate** and **AVFoundation** for efficient audio processing:

- **Audio Capture**: Use `AVAudioEngine` or `AudioQueue` to get microphone input frames. Configure the audio session for low latency (e.g. 48 kHz, 1 channel, 16-bit PCM) and a buffer duration like 10–20 ms. For Discord voice, 48 kHz mono with 20 ms frames (960 samples) is common. You can set the audio engine’s input node to provide buffers of a certain length. Smaller buffers reduce latency at the cost of more frequent callbacks; 256 samples (~5 ms) or 512 (~10 ms) is a good starting range on macOS/iOS.
- **Frame Buffering**: To create a mel spectrogram frame, you typically need a window of audio (e.g. 1024 samples for 20 ms at 48 kHz or ~50 ms at 22 kHz). Use a circular buffer to accumulate audio samples from the input callback. Once you have the required window, apply a window function (Hann) and perform an FFT. Apple’s vDSP library in Accelerate offers optimized FFT routines. For example, you can set up a `FFTSetup` once and reuse it. The Accelerate framework even has sample code for computing a real-time mel spectrum using matrix math ([Accelerate Sample Code - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/accelerate/sample-code/#:~:text=Generate%20a%20real,of%20audio%20using%20matrix%20multiplication)). Essentially, you can prepare a precomputed mel filter bank matrix (dimensions `[n_mel × (n_fft/2+1)]`) and multiply it with the power spectrum vector to get mel energies. This avoids looping in Swift and pushes work to optimized BLAS routines.
- **Mel Spectrogram Parameters**: Ensure you use the same parameters that your models were trained with. Common settings for TTS/VC models: 16 kHz–24 kHz audio, 50 ms FFT window (e.g. 1024 samples at 22.05 kHz) with 12.5 ms hop (256 samples hop) ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07815#:~:text=window%20size%20and%20a%20256,Vocoder)), 80 mel bands, frequency range 0–8 kHz (for 16 kHz) or 0–12 kHz (for 24 kHz). If using a higher sample rate like 44/48 kHz, you might see 1024 FFT, 256 hop still (covering up to ~22 kHz). The key is that the mel-spectrogram fed to the vocoder must match what the vocoder expects. For instance, HiFi-GAN typically uses 80-dim mel from 22.05 kHz audio ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07815#:~:text=QuartzNet%20,conditioned%20on%20the%20speaker%20embedding)) ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07815#:~:text=window%20size%20and%20a%20256,Vocoder)). So you may downsample the mic input to the model’s sample rate (Accelerate’s vDSP has vImage for resampling, or you can use AVAudioEngine’s output format to enforce a sample rate).
- **Swift Code Example**: Pseudo-code for mel extraction – you can use `vDSP_convert` to go Int16->Float, `vDSP_fft_zip` for FFT, then `vDSP_zvabs` to get magnitudes. Next, multiply by mel filter bank: `vDSP_mmul(melFilterMatrix, spectrum, &melEnergies, nMel, 1, fftBins)`. Finally take log or log10 for log-mel. Apple’s Accelerate guide demonstrates generating a mel spectrum via matrix multiplication for real-time audio ([Accelerate Sample Code - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/accelerate/sample-code/#:~:text=Generate%20a%20real,of%20audio%20using%20matrix%20multiplication)). Using these vectorized operations in Swift will keep your preprocessing overhead very low (likely a millisecond or two per frame on M3).

By doing audio preprocessing natively, you avoid having to include something like Python or Librosa. It also lets you tune the pipeline: for example, you might compute the mel for a 20 ms frame and feed it immediately to the Core ML model (which might produce 20 ms of audio output). This **frame-by-frame streaming** approach minimizes latency compared to processing an entire 1-second chunk. Make sure to apply the same pre-emphasis or normalization as the training code (some models normalize the mel spectrogram to a certain dB range or use log10 and compression). These details should be gleaned from the model’s training configuration.

### Inference Pipeline and Latency Optimizations
When performing the model inference in Swift, consider the following for maximum performance:

- **Use MPSGraph/BNNS for Custom Ops**: If your model or preprocessing has any custom operations that aren’t in Core ML (for example, pitch shifting or formant scaling in some pipelines), you can use **Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)** or **BNNS**. MPSGraph is a new GPU-accelerated tensor API, and BNNS (Basic Neural Network Subroutines) is a CPU acceleration library. Apple demonstrated using BNNS Graph API for real-time audio processing at WWDC 2024 ([Support real-time ML inference on the CPU - WWDC24 - Videos](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10211/#:~:text=Support%20real,BNNS%20Graph%20in%20Swift)), highlighting that it incurs minimal overhead on the CPU. In many cases, you won’t need this – but if you wanted to, say, implement a small DSP (like a formant shifter or an IIR filter for formant correction) alongside your ML model, doing it with Accelerate or MPS will be faster than in pure Swift. The bottom line is to keep as much computation as possible in vectorized/accelerated frameworks rather than Swift loops.
- **Batching and Pipeline Fusion**: Core ML can execute multiple models concurrently if they use different compute units (ANE vs GPU vs CPU). However, since your use-case is streaming, you’ll likely run the models serially for each audio frame: Speaker encoder (occasionally) -> Conversion model -> Vocoder. To reduce latency, you can **merge the conversion model and vocoder** into one Core ML model. For example, the conversion model could output a mel spectrogram which is immediately fed into the vocoder part (this could be done by merging the NN graphs). This saves writing intermediate mel to memory and reduces function call overhead. If merging is not feasible, you can still run them back-to-back in the same audio callback. Use a single audio buffer as input to both, or even process the next frame’s mel while the vocoder is synthesizing the previous frame’s audio (if different threads/hardware units are used). On M3 Max, there are ample resources (many GPU cores and 16+ ANE cores), so you could potentially run the vocoder on the ANE and concurrently run the next mel extraction on the CPU/GPU.
- **Buffering and Audio I/O**: To maintain sub-100ms end-to-end delay, use a double-buffer technique. While Frame N is being processed by the model, you should be recording Frame N+1 from the mic. AVAudioEngine’s input node can give you callbacks on a high-priority audio thread – **do minimal work there** (just buffer the PCM) and signal your processing thread to generate the converted audio. After inference, output the audio using an `AVAudioPlayerNode` or a custom RemoteIO render callback. By overlapping input, compute, and output, you can achieve a steady streaming with, say, 20 ms frames and maybe 20 ms processing time, yielding ~40 ms latency plus any audio device buffering (~20 ms), totaling ~60 ms. This is below the 100 ms goal.
- **Memory Management**: Use persistent buffers (avoid alloc/dealloc each frame). Preallocate the FFT setup, mel filter matrix, Core ML model instances, etc., at start. Core ML models can be loaded once and reused for each prediction – creating the `MLModel` is expensive, but calling `.prediction()` is fast especially if the model is already on the device (ANE/GPU context warm). Also, consider using the new **async prediction** APIs (Core ML in iOS17+ has `predictions(from:options:) async` which can avoid blocking threads). This could let you call the model and await result without blocking the audio thread.

### Example Pipeline Architecture (for Minimum Latency)
1. **Audio Thread** (real-time): read 10–20 ms of microphone audio into a ring buffer. If enough samples for one frame, copy them to a work buffer and notify the ML thread. If using frame overlap (e.g., 50% overlap for better continuity), handle windowing appropriately (you might keep a history buffer).
2. **ML Thread** (background high-priority): once notified, take the audio frame, compute mel spectrogram (via Accelerate). Pass the mel (and target speaker embedding, which you computed once from a sample of target voice) into the Core ML **conversion+vocoder model**. Receive the output audio frame (e.g.,  wav samples of length equal to the hop or window). This inference should be, say, 5–20 ms.
3. **Audio Output**: send the output audio frame to an output AudioEngine node. You might use a buffering audio player node or directly write to the output in a render callback. Make sure to time-align it with the input (some jitter buffering may be needed if processing time varies). But since we’re aiming for sub-100ms, you likely will just introduce a fixed 1–2 frame delay buffer.

Throughout this process, leverage vectorization and Apple’s optimized frameworks. The M3 Max’s GPU and Neural Engine thrive on large batches, but for streaming audio, the batch is small – so the overhead of scheduling work to the ANE might become noticeable if each frame is tiny. To mitigate this, it’s often beneficial to process slightly larger chunks if you can tolerate it – for example, process 50 ms at a time (instead of 20 ms) to amortize overhead. 50 ms is still generally unnoticeable in conversation latency. It’s a trade-off: smaller chunks = lower latency, larger chunks = higher throughput.

Given Apple’s hardware, a reasonable approach is **20 ms frames with 4× overlap (5 ms hop)** for the best continuity, or **no overlap with 20–40 ms frames** for simplicity. Start simple (maybe 20 ms non-overlapping) and measure latency. You can adjust frame size as needed.

# Open-Source Resources and Examples

### Pretrained Models and Repositories
Luckily, many components you need are available in open-source projects:

- **Real-Time Voice Cloning (RTVC)** – *Repo*: CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning ([GitHub - CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning: Clone a voice in 5 seconds to generate arbitrary speech in real-time](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning#:~:text=Real)) ([GitHub - CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning: Clone a voice in 5 seconds to generate arbitrary speech in real-time](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning#:~:text=1802,for%20Speaker%20Verification%20This%20repo)). This project contains a pretrained GE2E speaker encoder and an implementation of a WaveRNN vocoder (along with a Tacotron synthesizer). While it targets TTS, you can reuse the **speaker encoder** (pretrained on LibriSpeech) and see how the vocoder was implemented. It’s PyTorch-based. You’d still need a conversion model (Tacotron is text-based, so not directly usable for VC), but the repo’s models can serve as a starting point.
- **AutoVC** – *Repo*: auspicious3000/AutoVC (PyTorch) ([AutoVC: Zero-Shot Voice Style Transfer with Only Autoencoder Loss](https://github.com/auspicious3000/autovc#:~:text=AutoVC%3A%20Zero,parallel%20voice%20conversion%20framework)). Contains the code and sometimes links to pretrained weights for the AutoVC model. You can use this to get a baseline zero-shot VC model. The input is a mel spectrogram and speaker embedding, output is a converted mel spectrogram. You would need to pair it with a vocoder (e.g., HiFi-GAN).
- **FragmentVC** – *Repo*: yistLin/FragmentVC ([GitHub - yistLin/FragmentVC: Any-to-any voice conversion by end-to-end extracting and fusing fine-grained voice fragments with attention](https://github.com/yistLin/FragmentVC#:~:text=FragmentVC)) ([GitHub - yistLin/FragmentVC: Any-to-any voice conversion by end-to-end extracting and fusing fine-grained voice fragments with attention](https://github.com/yistLin/FragmentVC#:~:text=Usage)). Provides the implementation and a pretrained model (with TorchScript export). This is a high-quality any-to-any VC model. It also links to a **universal vocoder** (WaveRNN-based) in the author’s repo ([GitHub - yistLin/FragmentVC: Any-to-any voice conversion by end-to-end extracting and fusing fine-grained voice fragments with attention](https://github.com/yistLin/FragmentVC#:~:text=Wav2Vec)). If you want to experiment with top-quality conversion, you can try to convert FragmentVC’s models to Core ML (bearing in mind the performance considerations discussed).
- **RAVE** – *Repo*:  acids-ircam/RAVE ([Realtime Neural Audio Synthesis - NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/community/jetson-projects/rave#:~:text=Realtime%20Neural%20Audio%20Synthesis%20,time%20audio%20synthesis)). This repo by IRCAM contains the official RAVE code, which includes training and export scripts. They even discuss exporting RAVE as a **VST plugin** and other formats ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=Investigating%20the%20viability%20of%20RAVE,is%20entangled%2C%20failing%20to%20ensure)), so you might find tools to export the trained model. Check if they have any pretrained “speech” model; if not, you might use their code to train on a voice dataset. RAVE is attractive for Apple Silicon because of its efficiency and the authors’ focus on real-time deployment.
- **HiFi-GAN** – *Repo*: jungilson/HiFi-GAN (and many forks). The original repo provides several pretrained models (e.g., **V1 universal** vocoder). The model definitions can be converted to Core ML. If you prefer a ready Core ML, you might look at the **Awesome-CoreML-Models** list ([likedan/Awesome-CoreML-Models - GitHub](https://github.com/likedan/Awesome-CoreML-Models#:~:text=likedan%2FAwesome,developers%20experiment%20with%20machine)) to see if someone already converted HiFi-GAN or similar. (As of now, it’s common to convert TTS models, so vocoders should be convertible too.)
- **UnivNet** – *Repo*: ming024/UnivNet (from the paper authors) or check Hugging Face for UnivNet models ([UnivNet - Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/univnet#:~:text=UnivNet%20,the%20field%20of%20voice)). You may find a pretrained model used in Tortoise-TTS (a slow TTS system which uses UnivNet vocoder). Converting that to Core ML would give you a high-quality vocoder.
- **LPCNet** – *Repo*: mozilla/LPCNet. It’s in C (TensorFlow for training), but if you need an ultra-efficient CPU vocoder, the C inference can potentially be wrapped in Swift (via Accelerate for matrix ops). It’s not Core ML, but mentionable as an aside.

In addition, the **Apple Personal Voice** research article ([Advancing Speech Accessibility with Personal Voice - Apple Machine Learning Research](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/personal-voice#:~:text=%2A%20Modified%20FastSpeech2,based%20vocoder%20model)) reveals their on-device TTS uses FastSpeech2 + WaveRNN. While Apple hasn’t open-sourced those models, it confirms that convolutional acoustic models and small RNN vocoders are viable on-device. For example, they mention using **dilated conv layers instead of Transformers** for faster inference ([Advancing Speech Accessibility with Personal Voice - Apple Machine Learning Research](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/personal-voice#:~:text=The%20acoustic%20model%20follows%20an,shippable%20on%20iPhone%20and%20iPad)) – a hint you might apply to any model you train.

### Swift Implementations and Utilities
While most of these models are in Python, a few Swift projects demonstrate on-device speech ML that you can draw inspiration from:

- **SwiftWhisper** – *Repo*: exPHAT/SwiftWhisper ([exPHAT/SwiftWhisper: The easiest way to transcribe audio in Swift](https://github.com/exPHAT/SwiftWhisper#:~:text=exPHAT%2FSwiftWhisper%3A%20The%20easiest%20way%20to,get%20audio%20frames%20into)). This isn’t voice conversion, but it’s a Swift Core ML implementation of OpenAI’s Whisper speech recognition. It handles real-time audio input, mel spectrogram computation in Swift, and Core ML model inference. Studying this can give you patterns for streaming audio through a Core ML model in Swift, which is very analogous to your task (microphone -> model -> output text, vs. microphone -> model -> output audio). It verifies that Accelerate can be used to process audio frames and that Core ML can handle large models (Whisper) in real-time on Apple Silicon.
- **Vocode** – *Repo*: vocode-io/vocode-core ([vocodedev/vocode-core: Build voice-based LLM agents ... - GitHub](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-core#:~:text=vocodedev%2Fvocode,time%20streaming%20conversations%20with%20LLMs)). This is a Python library for building real-time voice chatbots, but it has some relevance. It integrates low-latency audio I/O with model inference (like text-to-speech and speech-to-text). While not Core ML, it might have useful architectural insights for handling audio streams and could potentially be extended to use Core ML models on Mac.
- **Core ML Tools & Converters** – *Repo*: apple/coremltools (official converters), and **madcato/huggingface-coreml** ([madcato/huggingface-coreml: This repository contains a ... - GitHub](https://github.com/madcato/huggingface-coreml#:~:text=madcato%2Fhuggingface,coreml)) – a community script collection for converting Hugging Face models to Core ML. If some of your target models (say a HF Hub vocoder) have conversion snippets, these can save time. The Hugging Face blog on Core ML ([Converting Models to Core ML](https://huggingface.co/blog/fguzman82/frompytorch-to-coreml#:~:text=Core%20ML%20is%20Apple%27s%20framework,a%20focus%20on%20PyTorch%20models)) ([Converting Models to Core ML](https://huggingface.co/blog/fguzman82/frompytorch-to-coreml#:~:text=The%20process%20of%20converting%20a,ML%20involves%20two%20main%20steps)) is a good reference, and Apple’s WWDC20 “Get models on device using Core ML converters” video is a thorough guide ([Get models on device using Core ML Converters - WWDC20 - Videos](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10153/#:~:text=Get%20models%20on%20device%20using,operations%20that%20extend%20the)).

In summary, there isn’t yet a turnkey “voice changer Swift app” open-source, but all the building blocks exist across projects. You will be pioneering by combining them for a Discord real-time voice clone. Leverage the above resources for pretrained weights and conversion tips, and don’t hesitate to use smaller models if a huge model doesn’t meet timing – quality can often be surprisingly good with optimized smaller models (as evidenced by 1.4M param encoders ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=We%20use%20the%20pre,we%20condition%20the%20decoder%20through)) and 2.3M param vocoders achieving MOS ~4.0).

# Performance Benchmarks and Expectations

### Latency and Throughput on Apple Silicon (M3 Max)
The Apple M3 Max is a very powerful chip, and although it’s not released at the time of writing, we can expect it to surpass the M2. For context, on an M1 (2020):
- A Multi-band GAN vocoder ran **6× faster than real-time** on CPU (RTF 0.16) ([GitHub - xcmyz/FastVocoder: Include Basis-MelGAN, MelGAN, HifiGAN and Multiband-HifiGAN, maybe NHV in the future.](https://github.com/xcmyz/FastVocoder#:~:text=RTF)).
- A lightweight RAVE-based VC model achieved **15× real-time on CPU** (RTF ~0.067) and over **140× on GPU** ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=S,RTF%20of%20the%20different%20models)) ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=As%20seen%2C%20the%20diffussion,time%20inference)). This implies it processed 1 second of speech in about 0.067s on an M1-class CPU.
- Even a larger model (AGAIN-VC, 7.9M params) was <0.5 RTF on CPU ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=Model%20Params%20Speed%20RTF%20AGAIN,RTF%20of%20the%20different%20models)), i.e. ~2 s for 1 s of audio.

Extrapolating to M3 Max: you have more Neural Engine cores (likely 18–20 cores) and a more advanced GPU. We can reasonably target **10–20× real-time total pipeline** on CPU/ANE, which corresponds to processing a 20 ms audio frame in about 1–2 ms. In other words, sub-100ms latency is well within reach. The bottleneck will likely be the vocoder, but if you use the ANE for the vocoder, it can handle many MACs per second (the M2 ANE does 15.8 TOPS, M3 likely higher).

Memory shouldn’t be an issue – even a 20M parameter model at FP16 is 40 MB, easily handled in unified memory. Just be mindful of **Neural Engine memory** limits: very large models may not fully fit on ANE and could page to DRAM, hurting latency. However, keeping models under say 50 MB each is a good practice.

### Performance Tuning Techniques
- **Profiling**: Use instruments to see if the Core ML inference is running on ANE or falling back to CPU. Sometimes ops like FFT (if you included one inside the model) might not be supported on ANE. It might be beneficial to perform FFT in Swift (Accelerate) and feed the magnitude to Core ML, to keep the Core ML model simpler (convolutions, etc., which ANE can do).
- **Real-Time Factors**: Aim for each stage’s RTF to be ~0.0X. For instance, speaker encoding is done infrequently (only when you change target voice or for a short calibration), so its speed is not critical. The conversion model should ideally be <0.1 RTF (i.e., <10 ms for 1 s of speech), and the vocoder maybe ~0.1–0.2 RTF (10–20 ms per 1 s audio). In combination, achieving an end-to-end RTF of ~0.2 or better will ensure low latency. Note that these RTFs are often measured on longer utterances; for very short frames, the effective RTF might worsen slightly due to fixed overhead. That’s why measuring actual frame processing time is important.
- **Batching Audio**: If you find that processing per frame is too slow due to overhead, consider processing slightly larger chunks (as mentioned). For example, process 100 ms at once (with overlap). This could still be streamed (outputting in 20 ms sub-chunks), but the model sees a bigger batch which allows it to better utilize the hardware. The ANE in particular likes bigger batches. There is a balance to strike to avoid too much delay.
- **Neural Engine vs GPU vs CPU**: The M3 Max will have a strong CPU too. It might be that running the entire pipeline on the CPU with vectorization achieves <100 ms, leaving the ANE free for other tasks. However, generally the ANE should give the best performance per watt. Using `.all` computeUnits lets Core ML decide – often it will schedule conv-heavy parts on ANE. If you want to force, you could try `.cpuAndNeural` or `.cpuAndGPU` and see which is faster. Sometimes the Neural Engine has a startup cost for each prediction; if that’s noticeable, you could try doing a warm-up prediction or using the new Core ML batching APIs to pipeline multiple frames.

### Benchmark Targets
- **Speaker Encoder**: ~5 ms to produce an embedding (for a few seconds of audio). This is typically done once, so not in the critical loop. For example, the Fast ResNet-34 encoder in S-RAVE was extremely fast (processing 1.6 s segments with 50% overlap in real-time easily) ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=We%20use%20the%20pre,we%20condition%20the%20decoder%20through)) ([RAVE for Speech: Efficient Voice Conversion at High Sampling Rates](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.16546v1#:~:text=As%20seen%2C%20the%20diffussion,time%20inference)).
- **Conversion Model**: ~1–2 ms for 20 ms audio frame. If using RAVE or AutoVC, this is just a few conv layers – likely very fast on ANE. Verify that any LSTMs are unrolled or small. A single unidirectional LSTM layer can run in a millisecond range if small (e.g. 256 units). If you have multiple or bi-LSTMs, that could be slower – in such case, prefer conv or GRU.
- **Vocoder**: ~5–10 ms for 20 ms audio. This is the heaviest. If HiFi-GAN is ~0.16 RTF on M1 CPU for 1 s (which is 160 ms), that’s ~3.2 ms per 20 ms audio. On M3, the CPU or ANE could likely do that in <2 ms. Multi-band splits will further reduce time (with a slight increase in complexity). If using WaveRNN on CPU, ensure to use vectorized kernels (Apple’s Accelerate has vDSP and vForce which can be used inside a custom Core ML CPU op or via BNNS if needed). But since HiFi-GAN quality is better, you might only fall back to WaveRNN if absolutely needed.

All these numbers suggest that achieving **sub-100ms** (and even ~50ms) total latency is feasible. Real user experiences (e.g., gaming voice changers on PC) often achieve ~30–50ms delays with similar model pipelines, and Apple’s hardware can match that. Always test with realistic conditions: different voice inputs, different target voices, etc., to ensure the pipeline remains within timing and the quality holds up (no glitches in audio).

Finally, keep an eye on resource usage. The M3 Max can handle a lot, but if you’re also running a game or Discord, you want to ensure the ML doesn’t max out the GPU or cause thermal throttling over long sessions. This is another reason to use the ANE – it operates independently of the GPU/CPU and will maintain performance even under load. Core ML will use ANE for most ops if you quantize to 8-bit. An anecdotal benchmark: the PersonalVoice TTS on an iPhone (A16 chip) can generate speech faster than real-time – the M3 Max is orders more powerful, so your use-case is well within what’s possible.
