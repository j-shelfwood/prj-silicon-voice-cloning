# Real-Time Voice Cloning on Apple Silicon (M3 Max)

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to build a real-time, low-latency AI voice cloning system optimized for Apple Silicon (e.g., ARM M3 Max). The primary objective is to enable live voice conversion during Discord or other live communication calls‚Äîsuch as replicating character voices (e.g., Uncle Iroh from Avatar)‚Äîusing native C or Swift for maximum performance and integration.

## üéØ Goals

- Achieve sub-100ms total latency for live voice conversion.
- Transform a user's voice into target character voices in real-time during Discord calls.
- Utilize Apple Silicon hardware (CPU, GPU, Neural Engine) efficiently, without performance overhead from Docker, Python runtimes, or virtualization layers.
- Build a foundational understanding of native Apple APIs including Core Audio, Accelerate, and Core ML.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Approach

The project involves:

- **Core Audio & AudioUnits** for minimal-latency audio input/output.
- **Accelerate Framework (vDSP, BNNS)** for high-performance signal processing and neural computation.
- **Metal and Core ML** for leveraging GPU and Neural Engine acceleration.
- Porting state-of-the-art voice conversion models from Python to native Core ML implementations.
- A carefully designed data pipeline to ensure real-time processing with deterministic latency.
- Audio routing to capture microphone input and feed processed audio to communication apps.

```

## üöß Development Plan

1. **Core Audio CLI Implementation:** Establish basic audio I/O via AudioUnits.
2. **Real-Time DSP**: Implement real-time FFT and audio transformations using Accelerate framework.
3. **Core ML Integration**: Load and run machine learning models for voice conversion using Swift.
4. **Voice Conversion Pipeline**: Integrate speaker embedding models and voice conversion models.
5. **Audio Routing**: Set up proper routing to capture and output audio for Discord integration.
6. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize for ultra-low latency, benchmark performance, and refine implementation iteratively.
